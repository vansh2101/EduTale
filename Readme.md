# EduTale
<i>Transforming Learning into Visuals</i>
<br><br>
EduTale is an innovative educational app designed to make learning engaging and fun by transforming study topics into captivating stories and visual comic strips. This app is perfect for students of all ages and anyone who wants to explore complex subjects in a creative and entertaining way.

- Users can input their study topic may it be from any subject such as history, science, literature, mathematics, and more.
- Once a topic is selected, the app generates a narrative storyline related to that topic. The story is designed to simplify complex concepts and make them relatable.
- The app converts the generated story into a visual comic format.

## Challenges we ran into üëÄ
The most challenging part was to create the function for generating comic blocks with ReactJS as there was a lot of data processing and many elements had to be combined in a single block. Also, another challenge was to deploy our app online and configure our frontend to make API requests with the backend as we were facing a Mixed-Content Type Error.
